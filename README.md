> [Wakanda Studio](http://www.wakanda.org/features/studio) Extension [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator


## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

#### Install npm
Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository, so first: 

[Super easy npm install](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/README.html#super-easy-install)

#### Install Yeoman

Next, you only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

#### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension. In the Wakanda serie, you might also be interested by the [Wakanda Project](https://github.com/amorgaut/generator-wakanda-project) and  [Wakanda Widget](https://github.com/midrissi/generator-wakanda-widget) generators.

To install the *Wakanda Extension* generator from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-wakanda-extension
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo wakanda-extension
```

## Wakanda Studio Extension

Wakanda Studio Extensions are programs that can add new features to Wakanda Studio. For example, you could create a Wakanda Studio extension to insert a set of predefined comments at the beginning of a JavaScript file.

You write an extension using standard Web technologies, such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Once you have developed a Wakanda Studio extension, you can share it with the Wakanda developer community. Our Wakanda development team has developed a few pre-installed extensions, such as "Beautifier" that you can use in the Code Editor to "beautify" your JavaScript code.

Extensions can be added to Wakanda Studio's main toolbar as well as from certain contextual menus in the Solution Explorer.
