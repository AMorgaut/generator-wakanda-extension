## Getting Started

### What are Wakanda Studio Extension?

Wakanda Studio Extensions are programs that can add new features to Wakanda Studio. For example, you could create a Wakanda Studio extension to insert a set of predefined comments at the beginning of a JavaScript file.

You write an extension using standard Web technologies, such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Once you have developed a Wakanda Studio extension, you can share it with the Wakanda developer community. Our Wakanda development team has developed a few pre-installed extensions, such as "Beautifier" that you can use in the Code Editor to "beautify" your JavaScript code.

Extensions can be added to Wakanda Studio's main toolbar as well as from certain contextual menus in the Solution Explorer.
